# Makerthon 2022
 Makerthon repo

The theme of Makerthon 2022 is Mental Wellbeing. For this Makerthon, I have (or will be!) creating an app that is meant to promote mental wellness within the community in NUS.


Credits to Rachelle for the icons.

If you're forking from this project to play around, set the icons to whatever you want! The current ones provided are placeholders, and there is no intention (as of now) to open source the actual icons.
