This is a list of to-dos, in order of priority
Functionalities:
1) Calendar-like function. To integrate with the colouring, so we have a proper coloured mood tracker
2) Questionnaire feature & screen <-- remember, needs to assign scoring to each quiz. We store this as a hidden value into
the calendar feature as well, and keep track of how many days a person is below/edging the threshold.
3) Curate list of resources
- Breathing exercises
- Face massage
- Stuff to encourage good mental hygiene

4) Settings screens stuff, which includes:
- Setting a time for notification
- Send feedback button
- About us

5) Services (by Volunteers and UHC)
- Talk to PFA
- Counsellor (hidden)
- Clinical Psych (hidden)
