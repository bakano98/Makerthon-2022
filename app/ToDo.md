This is a list of to-dos, in order of priority
Functionalities:

1. Calendar-like function. To integrate with the colouring, so we have a proper coloured mood tracker (J will do this. I will help out as well.)

2. Thresholds for Questionnaire redirection (S will provide me with the thresholds. Then I will do the linking to screens)

3. Curate list of resources (R & S will do this. After S is done, simply add in to the screens)

- Breathing exercises
- Face massage
- Stuff to encourage good mental hygiene

7. UI/UX

- Background pictures for screens
- Icons stuff
