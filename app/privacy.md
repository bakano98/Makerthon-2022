#Moodal: Privacy Policy

This app is developed by Wei Jie. The source code is available on GitHub.

Data collected, such as your name, student number (NUS students) and email is only stored on local storage, so no back-end server will be aware of it.

Data will not be collected unless you want to use a service that has explicitly been stated to need to collect your data. This has little effect on the overall experience/usage of the app, so do not worry.

If there are any issues/vulnerabilities found, do not hesitate to reach me at bakainochi@gmail.com. I will reply at the earliest convenience and fix them as soon as possible

Regards,
Wei Jie,
