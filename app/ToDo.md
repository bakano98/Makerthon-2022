This is a list of to-dos, in order of priority
Functionalities:

1. Calendar-like function. To integrate with the colouring, so we have a proper coloured mood tracker
2. Questionnaire feature & screen <-- remember, needs to assign scoring to each quiz. We store this as a hidden value into
   the calendar feature as well, and keep track of how many days a person is below/edging the threshold.
3. Curate list of resources

- Breathing exercises
- Face massage
- Stuff to encourage good mental hygiene

4. Settings screens stuff, which includes:

- Setting a time for notification
- Send feedback button
- About us

5. Services (by Volunteers and UHC)

- Talk to PFA
- Counsellor (hidden)
- Clinical Psych (hidden)

6. Saving on local storage + fetching from local storage

- AsyncStorage?
- Need to save and get back those states. This will be done as soon as mood tracking is done.

UI 2) Update positioning of buttons on main screen 3) Background pictures for screens

MISC
... Saving overall app state, and loading on startup

<------------------------------------------------------------ COMPLETED STUFF ------------------------------------------------------------>

1. Colour-based mood changing, mood selection
2. Helplines screen
3. Helplines kinda beautified. More UI updates to come.
4. Screens setup pretty much done

Hidden Screens:

- Questionnaire screen is pretty much done. Left UI/UX updates
  --> Form fillup
  --> Still needs to link to each different screen (Resources, PFA, Counsellor, Psych)
