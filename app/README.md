# Moodal

This app was created during NUS' Makerthon 2022. The theme was "Mental Wellbeing within the Community".

With this in mind, my team and I decided to create a mood trakcing app with tele-medicine capabilities. Essentially, this meant that we had to set up some kind of flow in order to connect students with the University's Counselling Services.

The app is 100% functional, with possible improvements in the future. Future commits are based off my availability as I will be the only one maintaining this project (technical aspect wise). To see the full journey, you can visit my documentation page (not exactly super clean) at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EyrSwwzp7EY-izEtZHcKszqCkYjeB1RwRSXcGyDVDw/edit?usp=sharing


# Description
This app has mood tracking capabilities, and rewards you with Noodals whenever you complete your mood tracking for the day!
Noodals can be used to unlock more Moodal skins (currently, Moustache and Sunglasses)

This app also has resources for users to browse through, to improve/maintain their mental hygiene. Resources have been curated from official sources, and most of the app was done based off actual, scientific research.
You are also able to set daily reminders from the app, to remind you to do your mood tracking.

Furthermore, we have a list of services for users to utilise. This is mainly for NUS students, but others can also use it. 
For example, one could talk to a PFA (to be completed next time, as we do not have the actual resources/capabilities for this yet!), or find a list of hotlines (anonymous or not), and even do the K-10 Mental Health survey, and we'll recommend you actions to be taken accordingly. Regrettably, the UHC visit is only meant for NUS students, but we hope that we're somehow able to extend this to actual hospitals outside of NUS.


# Feedback
You can provide feedback via the app, or you can email me at: bakainochi@gmail.com to give feedback. It would be greatly appreciated!


# Future plans
As it is, I think the app might be a little sluggish. I blame Expo and using React Native, so if I wanted to improve performance, I might learn Flutter and port the app over to Flutter.
However, the most feasible thing right now would be to optimise the code more -- as much as I possibly can. Most of the things have already been refactored to the best of my current abilities, so...
We also hope to be able to incentivise people to use the app more, not just through in-app rewards, but possibly tangible rewards. So if we could manage to get some sort of sponsors, then we would be able to incentivise people by giving out E-vouchers!
